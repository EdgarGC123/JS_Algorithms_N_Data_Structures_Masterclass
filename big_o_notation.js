//the question is, how do we determine the best code when we have different approaches to a problem. 

//big O gives us a numerical representation, rather that a great or not good grading system.

//who cares?
//job interviews, it's important to have a precise vocab to talk about how our code performs. 
//working for large companies or working with huge data sets. we need to know how code compares to others. 
//debugging, if there aren't errors but something is slowing it down. it helps us identify inefficient points.

space complexity

primitive's are constant space (boolean, numbers, undefined, null)
strings require O(n) space (where n is  the string length)
reference types are generally O(n) aka array's or objects

/* 
accessing a value, with a valid index,Â is constant time. it goes straight to that point in the array. 

Adding a value at the end like normal is O(1) aka pushing to an array,
but adding at the beginning requires the entire array to re-index everything.

Same thing goes when you are removing from the begining of the array,
this requires the array to be re-indexes. 

push and pop is always faster than shift and unshift
