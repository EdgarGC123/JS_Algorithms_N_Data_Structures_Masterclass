/*DATA STRUCTURES
They are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. many different types.


Why so many?
diff ds' excel at different things. some are highly specialized while others like arrays are more generally used. 

Why do we care? 
the more time you spend as a dev, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures. 

working in the DOM is considered manipulating a tree (vanilla or jquery)

there is no one BEST structure. they all excel in different situations

working with map/location data? use a graph. 
need an ordered list with fast inserts and removals at the beginning and end? use a linked list
web scraping nested html? use a tree
need to use a scheduler? use a binary heap

================================================================================================================================================

what is a class? 
a blue print for creating obj's with pre-defined properties and methods.
